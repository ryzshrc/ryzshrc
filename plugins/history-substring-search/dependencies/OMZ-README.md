## RyZshrc Distribution Notes

What you are looking at now is RyZshrc's repackaging of zsh-history-substring-search as an RYZ module inside
the RyZshrc distribution.

The upstream repo, zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search, can be found on GitHub at
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search.

Everything above this section is a copy of the original upstream's README, so things may differ slightly when
you're using this inside RYZ. In particular, you do not need to set up key bindings for the up and down arrows
yourself in `~/.zshrc`; the RYZ plugin does that for you. You may still want to set up additional emacs- or
vi-specific bindings as mentioned above.
